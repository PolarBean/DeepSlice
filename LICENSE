DeepSlice source code Â© [2022] Macquarie University patent pending in Australia, and contact Macquarie University for other countries. Macquarie University
grants users a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable licence to copy, reproduce and adapt DeepSlice only for use for non-commercial research 
purposes and not for other purposes without Macquarie University's prior written consent. DeepSlice is made available on the basis that it is released as a test 
version, 'as is', and should only be used for coronal images of the adult mouse brain, and may contain errors or produce results that are incorrect. DeepSlice 
or its derivatives should not be used or released for commercial use and cannot at present be reliably used to analyse brain images from species other than the 
mouse. Users agree that if they adapt DeepSlice, and make those adaptations available for others to use, they will release the adapted source code to GitHub on 
the same terms as this licence
